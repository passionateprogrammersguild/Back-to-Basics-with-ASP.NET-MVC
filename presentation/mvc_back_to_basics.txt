#Before we Begin
* How many people are familiar with the MVC pattern as it was defined back in 1978?
* How many people work with ASP.NET MVC in your jobs
* How many people are familiar with how ASP.NET mvc applies the MVC pattern
* How many people are aware of where ASP.NET MVC falls short in terms of implementing the MVC pattern
* How many people care about this subject at all :(

#Tools of the Trade
* ASP.NET MVC2
* Web Forms View Engine
* .NET 3.5
* AutoFac 2.4.5
* jquery v1.4.1
* jquery.rating plugin

#In the Beginning
* University of Oslo Professor Trygve M. H. Reenskaug documented the terms MVC while visiting the Smalltalk group at Xerox PARC in 1978
* Smalltalk included an implementation of MVC as a result of Trygve M. H. Reenskaug's work
* Several whitepapers where written on the subject including
    * THING-MODEL-VIEW-EDITOR - An Example of a planning system
    * MODELS - VIEWS - CONTROLLERS
    * The Model-View-Controller (MVC). - Its Past and Present
    * Applications Programming in Smalltalk-80(TM): How to use Model-View-Controller (MVC)
* The intent of MVC was to capture a representation of the users mental model of the domain
* Naked objects was a design pattern established in 2004 by Richard Pawson that took MVC to the next level 

#A Pictures worth a thousand words
![MVC Communication](../MVCCommunication.png "MVC Communication")

#Definition of Terms
* Model - Holds the user’s object model with its information and behaviour, reflecting the user’s mental model of the domain. Model is responsible for informing the view when its state changes.
* View - Capable of showing one or more pictorial representations of the Model. 
* Controller - Receives user input, translates it into the appropriate messages and pass these messages on to one or more of the views or to the Model if a state change is warranted

#The MVC in ASP.NET MVC
* Model 
    * View models have become king recently where the model is primarily a container for data
    * Models do not communicate state changes to the View
    * Models are provided by the controller to the View
* View
    * The View is divided into two parts namely the View Engine and the ViewPage
    * The View can be bound to a model but it is not required.
    * The View can be composed of multiple views called Partials
    * Use of DisplayFor and EditorFor makes use of Partials to customize the view for the model
* Controller
    * Controller actions receives requests through the routing engine
    * The DefaultModelBinder translates parameters of the request into the arguments of the action method
    * You can write your own custom model binders
    * Responsible for determining what happens next in terms of the ActionResult returned 

#ASP.NET MVC / MVC pattern meld
* How ASP.NET MVC Supports the Pattern
    * Strongly typed views support the pattern since the model is tightly bound to the view
    * PartialViews make views composible
    * Html helpers assist in making views composable and reusable to a degree
    * ModelBinding makes sense of the request which is the primary responsibility of the Controller
    * Routing binds a user request to the users mental model of the domain
* How ASP.NET MVC Does Not Support the Pattern
    * The user communicates with the View directly and not the Controller
    * The Controller does not send messages to the Model for the model to change it state
    * The Model cannot inform the view of state changes

#DEMO

#Supplimenting ASP.NET MVC with other Tools
* Due to the execution boundry between the client and the server you may need MVC on the client
* [Knockout.js](http://http://knockoutjs.com/) is a javascript framework that implements MVVM on the client
* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) seems to be a MVC framework without the C 
* [JavascriptMVC](http://www.javascriptmvc.com/) is what is says it is
